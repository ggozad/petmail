Petmail

 https://github.com/warner/petmail

Petmail is a secure communication/file-sharing system. It is a reboot of my
earlier "Petmail" spam-resistant mail system (http://petmail.lothar.com/),
continuing the aims of that project but not sharing any code. It also draws
inspiration from Tahoe-LAFS, Dropbox, Pond/Panda, and others.

How To Run Petmail
------------------

To run from source, you will need Python (2.x) and the development headers
(python-dev). You will then build the dependencies, create and start a node,
and open the web-based control panel like so:

* python setup.py build_deps
* ./bin/petmail create-node
* ./bin/petmail start
* ./bin/petmail open

Users are encouraged to run a pre-packaged application instead. Once you
start this application, use the menu item to open the control panel.

Theory Of Operation
-------------------

[this section contains forward-looking statements and is likely to contain
intentions rather than accomplishments]

Each Petmail node runs as a background application on your local computer.
All interaction takes place through a browser-based control panel, which you
can open by running `petmail open`.

Through the control panel, you can access the `Address Book`, which contains
contact information for everyone Petmail knows about. Use `Invitations` to
add people to your address book. You can exchange messages with people
through `Rooms`. You can also transfer files by dragging them into a Room.
Petmail also provides folder synchronization between computers (either your
own, or with other people).

To receive messages, you will need a `Mailbox`, which is a server that runs
all the time and has a publically-reachable IP address. You can run your own
mailbox, if you have a server like that, or someone else may run a mailbox
for you.

To store files, either to transfer to others or to synchronize with yourself,
you'll need a `Storage Server`. Again, this requires uptime and a public IP.
Petmail nodes can be configured to use S3 and other commodity storage systems
for this role, however some systems are only suitable for share-with-self
use, not share-with-others.

instructions and protocol specifications.
